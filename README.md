# animal-landing-page
 
This would be a landing page for the Animal Wellness Foundation.  It is made entirely in HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript.  The section involving animal facts fetches data from an API named Meowfacts.  It obtains one random cat fact and displays it on the screen.  A user can click a button and generate facts for as long as they want.

The website is also mobile-responsive and adjusts elements as the width of the screen changes.
