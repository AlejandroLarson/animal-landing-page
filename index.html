            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <h4>Animal Wellness Foundation, a 501(c3) organization, helps animals by:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Raising funds for companion animals of low-income families</strong> and for the housing and rehabiliation of homeless animals. Each year millions of companion animals are euthanized in the United States due to overpopulation and owner relinquishment. We offer assistance to low-income families so that companions can remain in their loving homes.</li>
                <li><strong>Rescuing & fostering animals found in situations of abuse, neglect or abandonment,</strong> as well as in city and county shelters. Our Los Angeles based rescue group, Animal Wellness Foundation Rescue fosters, socializes and rehabilitates homeless animals with a network of staff and volunteers getting each animal ready for their forever home. </li>
                <li><strong>Funding spay, neuter, and vaccination programs</strong> with our partners at Animal Wellness Centers veterinary hospitals, so that every animal in our care receives the medical treatment they need.</li>
                <li><strong>Supporting animal protection policies at the federal level</strong> with our political partner, Animal Wellness Action and our very own Animal Wellness Veterinary Council, getting veterinary experts to the frontline of the animal protection movement.</li>
            </ul>

Frankie loves to make an appearance on my work zoom calls by climbing up the side of my chair which everyone enjoys. They are so great with the kids too. Olivia sleeps on the top bunk with Oliver every night. Frankie likes to make the rounds. Thank you, thank you, thank you for rescuing them"</p>

                    <p>Phoenix & Sedona were rescued from a struggling high kill shelter in Arizona. They were angels from the start and stole everyone's hearts.

                        Within weeks, the sisters found their forever guardians and have already made new friends. They continue to get medical care through our partner hospital, Animal Wellness Centers, until spayed and neutered.</p>
